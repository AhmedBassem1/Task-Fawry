# Task-Fawry

This repository contains my solutions to two tasks that I worked on:

## 1. `mygrep.sh`
I created a simple script to mimic the behavior of the `grep` command. The script allows:
- Searching for strings in a case-insensitive way.
- Displaying line numbers with the `-n` option.
- Inverting the match with the `-v` option.

I also made sure that combinations like `-vn` and `-nv` work correctly, and the script handles errors or invalid input properly.

## 2. Internal Service Connectivity Issue
For the second task, I had to troubleshoot an internal web dashboard (`internal.example.com`) that users couldn’t reach, even though the service was running. After checking DNS settings and making sure the service was up, I figured out the issues and restored the connectivity.

You’ll find screenshots and terminal outputs throughout the repository that show the steps I followed to fix these issues.
